# Search And Compare

## Search Modes

Paperbase should support:

- keyword search
- semantic retrieval
- structured filtering

Search scope should be explicit:

- full corpus
- one collection
- one field-specific curated database

## Current Module Map

The first search/read-model layer should stay intentionally thin:

- `src/paperbase/search/index_templates.py` — Elasticsearch-style mappings for paper, chunk, and figure documents
- `src/paperbase/search/indexer.py` — deterministic builders for paper, chunk, and figure documents
- `src/paperbase/search/query_builder.py` — text, filter, and vector query composition

This layer is a read-model scaffold, not a full search service. It should be reusable by the future Paperbase API, worker indexing jobs, and Arxie retrieval gateway.

## Comparison

Comparison is a database feature, not just an agent prompt.

The database should be able to return normalized comparison slices such as:

- method families
- dataset/metric result rows
- engineering tricks across a collection
- figures or captions tied to evidence
