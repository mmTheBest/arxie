> **🚧 Pre-release — Active Development.** Core pipeline works. Advanced features (lit reviews, citation graphs, confidence scoring) shipping now.

Ask a research question. Get an answer backed by real papers from Semantic Scholar and arXiv — with inline citations you can actually verify.

```
100-question eval suite · 5 retrieval tools · APA citations · Full-text PDF parsing · FastAPI · Docker-ready
```

### Features

- **Full-Text Analysis:** Downloads and reads entire papers — methods, results, tables, figures. Not just abstracts. The agent reasons over what researchers actually wrote.
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning:** Compares methodologies across papers, follows evidence chains, and synthesizes insights from multiple sources in a single query. "Compare LoRA vs QLoRA" reads both papers and gives you a real comparison.
- **Literature Review Generation:** Generates structured, multi-section literature reviews with thematic grouping, key findings, research gaps, and future directions. `ra lit-review "your topic"` and get a publication-ready draft.
- **Citation Graph Exploration:** Traces how ideas evolve through citation chains over time. "Show me how attention mechanisms developed from 2015 to 2024" maps the influence flow across papers.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Shows evidence strength per claim — how many papers support it, how many contradict it, and overall confidence level. You see the landscape, not just a summary.
- **Interactive Research Sessions:** Multi-turn conversations with memory. Ask a question, then refine: "dig deeper into the transformer variants", "find contradicting evidence", "compare with the 2023 papers". `ra chat` for conversational research.
- **Live Retrieval:** Searches Semantic Scholar + arXiv in real-time — including papers published today. No training cutoff.
- **Verified Citations:** Every claim links to a real paper with a real DOI. Inline (Author et al., Year) format with a formatted References section.

### Why Arxie

- **Reads full papers, not just metadata.** Most RAG tools stop at titles and abstracts. Arxie downloads PDFs and reads methods, results, and discussion sections. It knows what the paper actually says.
- **Compares papers for you.** Instead of reading 20 papers yourself, ask Arxie to compare methodologies, find contradictions, or identify which approach has the strongest evidence. Multi-hop reasoning across the literature.
- **Generates real literature reviews.** Not bullet-point summaries — structured reviews with thematic grouping, research gaps, and future directions. The kind you'd actually put in a paper.
- **Shows you the evidence, not just conclusions.** Confidence scoring tells you "12 papers support this, 2 contradict it" so you can judge the strength of any claim yourself.
- **Always current.** Searches live databases including papers published today. No training data cutoff.
- **Every citation is real.** DOI and arXiv links included. Click and read the source.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmTheBest/arxie.git
cd arxie

# Setup
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Ask a question
ra query "What are the main approaches to neural machine translation?"

# Interactive mode
ra chat

# Generate a literature review
ra lit-review "attention mechanisms in computer vision"

# Trace citation influence
ra trace "Attention Is All You Need"

# Run evaluation
ra eval --dataset tests/eval/dataset.json --output results/
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t arxie .
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." arxie ra query "Your question here"
```

### API

```bash
# Start the server
uvicorn ra.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is retrieval-augmented generation?"}'
```

### Evaluation

Arxie ships with a 100-question evaluation suite across three difficulty tiers:

| Tier | Questions | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Factual | 40 | Who/what/when about known papers and methods |
| Analytical | 40 | Compare methods, explain techniques, analyze tradeoffs |
| Synthesis | 20 | Cross-paper analysis, research gaps, emerging trends |

**Target metrics:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Citation precision | ≥ 85% |
| Claim support ratio | ≥ 80% |
| Tool success rate | ≥ 90% |
| Latency p95 | ≤ 30s |

Run the eval:
```bash
ra eval --dataset tests/eval/dataset.json --output results/
```

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required. Your OpenAI API key. |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Custom endpoint (for proxies/relays). |
| `RA_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model for the agent. Any OpenAI-compatible model. |
| `RA_AGENT_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retries on transient API errors. |
